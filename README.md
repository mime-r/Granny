This is my fifth day in this house. She chases me wherever I go. I'm quite injured and my body hurts. The only thing I remember before I woke up in this house is that I was driving when my car suddenly broke down. I went out to see what the problem was when someone suddenly hit me in the head.

Made by Samuel Cheng.

This game includes the infamous Granny NPC. Inspired by Zork.
Try "xyzzy"! :)
